Money is usually described by three characteristics:
- It makes sense to save in it, because itâ€™s the rarest thing I know â†’ Store of Value (`SoV`)
- It makes sense to pay with it, because I donâ€™t want to carry vouchers and other nonsense in my wallet â†’ Medium of Exchange (`MoE`)
- It makes sense to think in it, because itâ€™s what I actually track when comparing options â†’ Unit of Account (`UoA`)

Today, practically no one believes that dollars function well as a store of value. Inflation eats away at savings, and anyone who manages to save a bit knows they need to find something else. Some go for stocks, others maybe for real estate. But saving in dollars is just foolish. In other words, dollars are failing in their ability to store value.

We still commonly use dollars for payments, and we also compare prices in dollars when making decisions. So in this regard, dollars still work relatively well. Or at least... it's somewhat of an illusion. Because comparing prices in dollars today is actually getting quite tricky. Suppliers might hold an offer for a few months, but everything has to be re-priced again and againâ€”todayâ€™s quotes are useless a year from now. But people donâ€™t know anything better, so they keep measuring in dollars. Even payments in dollars donâ€™t work all that well. But you rarely run into issuesâ€”usually when you ask the bank to transfer "your" money somewhere, theyâ€™ll happily do it. They rarely even ask for details.

So it seems that dollarsâ€”and all so-called fiat currencies in generalâ€”have lost their ability to store value. The other characteristics are still holding up reasonably well. Bitcoin fans imagine that this is the first battleground won, and the remaining two will follow in time. However, this failure of fiat isnâ€™t something new. Itâ€™s not that fiat is collapsing under the weight of bitcoin. Fiat has been collapsing fairly steadily since day one, and bitcoin has very little to do with it. Many fiat currencies failed quickly, but the collapse is usually dragged out over decades. In other words, fiat was just as bad even before bitcoin existed.

And bitcoin, on the contrary, even has a chance to improve fiat. Competition generally leads to better quality. And when thereâ€™s a real alternative, it becomes harder to devalue fiat.

When someone begins to understand bitcoin, itâ€™s usually through the realization that itâ€™s an interesting savings tool. We save for many years ahead, put in money we can afford to lose, etc. And after a few years, we realize it was actually a good idea. As enthusiasts, we slowly start to pay with it wherever possible (MoE), and then the rest follows almost naturally. Eventually, weâ€™ll even start to think in bitcoin (UoA).

Thereâ€™s a known progression:
`Store of Value` â†’ `Medium of Exchange` â†’ `Unit of Account`

[Josef TÄ›tek](https://damus.io/npub1llkvd2zh596r437k5guqqpvktn0jtz4tasn3zfqnjuktue33wagqm2ftee) says that the third characteristic (UoA) is redundant, because once youâ€™re paying with something, youâ€™re already thinking in it. Thatâ€™s kind of true â€” but this logic works in all directions:

- If I think in dollars, Iâ€™ll tend to pay in dollars (UoA â†’ MoE)
- If I think in dollars, Iâ€™ll tend to save in dollars (UoA â†’ SoV)
- If I pay in dollars, Iâ€™ll tend to think in dollars (MoE â†’ UoA)
- If I pay in dollars, Iâ€™ll tend to save in dollars (MoE â†’ SoV)
- If I save in dollars, Iâ€™ll tend to pay in dollars (SoV â†’ MoE)
- If I save in dollars, Iâ€™ll tend to think in dollars (SoV â†’ UoA)

So the order of adoption can be completely arbitrary.

For example, to use bitcoin in transactions (MoE), you need a counterparty. But to think in bitcoin, you donâ€™t need anyone else. You donâ€™t have to wait for global adoptionâ€”just start expressing your finances in bitcoin for yourself. You donâ€™t even need to own any bitcoin to do thisâ€”you donâ€™t even have to trust it. But you should be honest with yourself and track the value of your assets in bitcoin as well. Feel free to include gold, dollars, or anything else.

Once you start tracking the important stuff in bitcoin over the long term, youâ€™ll realize that bitcoin is absolutely unique. And as a unit of account, itâ€™s unbeatable (just like in its other qualities). Suddenly, you find out that a great 8% return on stocks still means youâ€™re losing value in bitcoin. A seemingly significant rise in real estate prices actually means youâ€™re getting poorer in bitcoin terms. In fact, compared to bitcoin, youâ€™re losing with everything.

That doesnâ€™t mean you should only hold bitcoin. Own whatever brings you joyâ€”but storing value in anything other than bitcoin is simply irrational.

Right now, itâ€™s extremely one-sided. But over time, bitcoinâ€™s growth will calm down. One day, a good investment might routinely beat bitcoin. Today, investing instead of holding bitcoin is risky, but over time that risk will diminish.


The obsession with "store of value" alone isnâ€™t healthy. Itâ€™s much better to embrace all three characteristics of bitcoin at once.

- ðŸ’­ Think in bitcoin, so you get real insight into how the value of your assets is evolving.
- ðŸ“ˆ Save in bitcoin, so you donâ€™t lose your wealth.
- ðŸ’ª Pay in bitcoin, so no one can stop you from doing so.
