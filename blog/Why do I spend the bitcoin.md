# I spend the bitcoin to have more bitcoin
- Hodl is about not speculating with shitcoins.
- It can also be interpreted as saving and non buying nonsense.
- However, it certainly doesn't mean that when you do buy something, you shouldn't use Bitcoin.

I think this is one of the biggest misunderstandings in the bitcoin adoption movement. Let’s have a look why do I think it doesn’t make sense to prefer pay with fiat and believe in bitcoin at the same time.

*The following graphs always display one month, from paycheck to paycheck.*

### 1. Bitcoin for saving, fiat for spending
Let’s imagine scenario of person who is trying to accumulate bitcoin - perceive it as a better money than fiat. For our example doesn’t matter if he gets paid in bitcoin or fiat. He needs both anyway. Let’s assume that he transfers bitcoin right after paycheck.

_Chart shows bitcoiners earned money balance during the month. Everything that he doesn’t need is stored in bitcoin and fiat is ready for spending._

### 2. First payment with bitcoin
Every exchange incurs certain costs, so our imaginary person doesn’t want to spend bitcoin and then go through the hassle of acquiring it again. Therefore, if he pays with bitcoin, he later feels regret that he should have kept that value in the best money in the world. He enjoys the feeling of supporting the ecosystem, but in reality, he suffers with every bitcoin payment.

### 3. Increased bitcoin stack
But the trick comes with another month. When our imaginary bitcoiner is expecting to pay with bitcoin he can store into bitcoin more value at the expense of fiat.

_Lets say that he earns 10k fiat units. He needs 4k for monthly cost and store remaining part into bitcoin. When he expects 1k of the payments to be done in bitcoin he can save into bitcoin 7k and 3k keep for other fiat payments. He still spends the same 4k, but the consequences of not having bitcoin are lowered._

### 4. No fiat needed
With every predictable purchase using bitcoin, he gradually reduces his dependence on fiat. Each step towards `#getonzero` has an effect. Once he pays for everything with bitcoin, he no longer needs any fiat. As a result, he is spending bitcoin but effectively hodling significantly more than a typical hodler who pays with stinky fiat.

### What is the conclusion?
→ Pay with bitcoin to hodl more bitcoin.
