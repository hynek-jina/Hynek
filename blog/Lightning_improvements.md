## List of Lightning Network improvements

What is happening? I don't actually know. So this is an effort to navigate the Lightning Network [LN] âš¡.

#### How currently LN works?
- I want to open a channel to someone
- Together we create a 2/2 multisig address
- We'll set up a closing transaction from which all the funds go to me
- I then send bitcoin to this multisig address in the agreed amount

**What is the problem?**
It works nice.. But it can be costly, transactions are failing sometimes, you need to lock a lot of liquidity, be always online and so on...

### Proposals
How to make it more effective (cheaper)

#### 1. Growing and shrinking channels

#### 3. Closing of more channels with one transaction
#### 4. Opening and closing with one transaction
#### 5. Adding output into closing transaction
#### 6. More owners of one channel
#### 7. More owners of one UTXO - (ie [Ark](https://www.arkpill.me/))
