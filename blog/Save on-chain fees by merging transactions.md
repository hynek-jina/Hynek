Send a transaction, and the recipient uses the coin for another payment. You then merge these two transactions together and save on fees. ðŸ”¥

If you have a Trezor, you can try this out on: https://coiner-mu.vercel.app/
_But be cautious. This is a hobby project without any guarantee._

## How does it work?
1. First, I connect Trezor, enter the passphrase, and select an account.
2. The application shows me my coins, pending transactions, and descendant transactions.
4. Next, I see how much I can save by merging all transactions and removing duplicate information.
5. Finally, I can sign and broadcast more efficient transaction
