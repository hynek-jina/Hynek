## How does it work?
1. Connect Trezor, enter the passphrase, and select an account.
2. The application display your coins, pending transactions, and descendant transactions.
4. Then app shows you how much you can save by merging all transactions and removing duplicate information.
5. Finally, you can sign and broadcast this more efficient transaction
